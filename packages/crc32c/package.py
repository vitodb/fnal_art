    This project collects a few CRC32C implementations under an umbrella
    that dispatches to a suitable implementation based on the host computer's
    hardware capabilities.

    CRC32C is specified as the CRC that uses the iSCSI polynomial in RFC 3720.
    The polynomial was introduced by G. Castagnoli, S. Braeuer and M. Herrmann.
    CRC32C is used in software such as Btrfs, ext4, Ceph and leveldb.
